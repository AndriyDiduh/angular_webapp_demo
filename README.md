A website with "Star Wars" content, built to be a testing ground for Angular & Typescript research. Project based on [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.5.

## Launch APP locally

In console run `ng serve` to launch dev server and test the APP locally. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

## Build for production

Run `ng build` to build the project. Compiled at `dist/` directory. 
Run `ng build --prod` for a production build.

## Run tests

Console test - Run `ng test` to execute automatic tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
"User" test - Run `ng e2e` to test as real user (robot that interacts automatically with app in browser to test the APP), done with [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
